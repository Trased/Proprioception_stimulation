# Proprioception Stimulation Device

This project is focused on the development of a **Proprioception Stimulation Device** aimed at delivering precise haptic feedback for enhanced user sensory experiences. The device integrates cutting-edge components for motion tracking and actuation, targeting applications in rehabilitation, gaming, and advanced sensory devices.

## Project Overview

### Purpose
The goal of this project is to create a device capable of stimulating proprioception through controlled haptic feedback. By combining motion tracking with advanced actuator technology, this device seeks to provide accurate, real-time feedback to users.

### Hardware Components
- **DA7280 LRA/ERM Driver**: A haptic driver designed for efficient and accurate control of actuators, featuring integrated waveform memory and resonant frequency tracking.
- **LSM9DS0 9DOF IMU**: A sensor module integrating a 3D accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer for motion detection and debugging.
- **VLV152564W Linear Resonant Actuator**: A compact actuator optimized for delivering strong and precise vibrations at resonant frequencies.

### Features
- **Precision Vibration Control**: Leveraging the DA7280 to create programmable and responsive haptic feedback.
- **Motion Tracking for Debugging**: Using the LSM9DS0 to visualize and refine actuator performance.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Hardware components are chosen for their low power consumption and high performance.

## Current Status
